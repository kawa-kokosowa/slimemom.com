### Who are we?

Democratic anarchist communist worker cooperative, working to create revenue and resume-enhancing opportunities for experiencers of transmisogyny and some of their allies.

Founded by [Lillian Gardenia Seabreeze](http://about.lillian.link/).

### ANARCHY?! COMMUNISM?!

We use member consensus-oriented decision-making. For more information on how we govern ourselves, please refer to the [SlimeMom.Com Handbook](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zLBIfaKPc39JtRlxYsbidR9bdP5E_Mdhct_TqvjMbhw/edit?usp=sharing).
