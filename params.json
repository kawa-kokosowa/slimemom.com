Author your page content here [using GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new `gh-pages` branch locally. If you’re using GitHub Desktop, simply sync your repository and you’ll see the new branch.\r\n\r\n### ANARCHY?! COMMUNISM?!\r\n\r\nWe use member consensus-oriented decision-making. For more information on how we govern ourselves, please refer to the [SlimeMom.Com Handbook](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zLBIfaKPc39JtRlxYsbidR9bdP5E_Mdhct_TqvjMbhw/edit?usp=sharing).\r\n\r\n### How to join\r\n\r\nTo apply for membership contact an existing member of SlimeMom.com to setup an interview (you can try lillian.gardenia.seabreeze@gmail.com). All memberships require member consensus.",
