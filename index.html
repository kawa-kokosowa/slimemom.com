    <h1>Who we are</h1>
    <p>Long version: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/15gxZ-4szP4WlPPpC18DJ_CmYGT7OjtN_QKjEXmeAaMg/edit?usp=sharing">read our bylaws</a>.</p>

    <p>Software engineer worker cooperative for those who experience transmisogyny.</p>

    <p>Safe hackspace which evenly distributes revenue to voting members, who are effectively the governance of Hen Coop Software.</p>

    <p>Who are the voting members? Victims of transmisogyny: trans women and nonbinary people, at all kinds of intersections, e.g., race, sexuality (bisexual, lesbian, asexual, etc.), impoverishment, sex workers, mentally ill, chronically ill.</p>

    <p>Diverse contract software engineers. Primarily focused on facilitation of freelance contracts for voting members. Secondarily focused on open source, permissively-licensed software projects (making, contributing).</p>

    <p>Curators of special projects, often involving 3rd party professionals, who may be cis men and cis women, who collaborate with our voting members. The rights of special projects belong entirely to their official contributors, but they are subject to our Code of Conduct. Right now we facilitate the following projects:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/lillian-gardenia-seabreeze/sappho">Sappho</a></li>
      <li><a href="http://gummygrime.tumblr.com/">Gummy Grime</a></li>
    </ul>

    <p>Carefully selecting applicants (especially from <a href="http://hypatiasoftware.org">Hypatia Software Organization</a>) by member vote, for Internships (of a prospective voting member). Right now Lillian Gardenia Seabreeze is offering a fun, intensive apprenticeship for open source game programming (Sappho)!</p>

    <p>Contributors to, as a community, the software projects of others who experience transmisogyny. If you are interested in this service, at great discount, or if unable to afford (free), please email contact@hencoop.software.</p>
